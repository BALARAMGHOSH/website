Helpers
=======

You will find them in

    ./app/helpers

The helpers must have this structure:

    class Main
      helpers do
        def my_helper
          ...
        end

        ...
      end
    end

These are regular Sinatra helpers. Check the [documentation](http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html#helpers) to find out more.
