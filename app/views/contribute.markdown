## Share your skeleton ##

Share your stack with the world.
Tell us about it on the mailing list and we'll include it in the Skeletons section.

The default skeleton is located at [http://github.com/monkrb/skeleton](http://github.com/monkrb/skeleton/tree/master).

## Improve Monk ##

Monk's code is located at [http://github.com/monkrb/monk](http://github.com/monkrb/monk/tree/master).

## Contribute to other projects ##

Monk applications are mostly a structure and a selection of components.
For example, the default skeleton ships with
[Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org), 
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com), 
[Haml](http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com), 
[Contest](http://labs.citrusbyte.com/projects/contest), 
[Stories](http://labs.citrusbyte.com/projects/stories), 
[Webrat](http://webrat.rubyforge.org).

You can report bugs and submit patches to those projects and you'll be contributing to Monk as well.
