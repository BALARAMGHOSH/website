About Monk
==========

Monk was extracted from a few projects developed in the span of one year by Citrusbyte developers. It provides a basic structure, a pragmatic approach to dependencies management, test and stories driven development, and a tool for managing many template projects.

It is open source software and glues some awesome libraries like [Rack][rack], [Sinatra][sinatra], [Webrat][webrat], [Thor][thor], [Contest][contest], [Stories][stories] and [Ohm][ohm].
