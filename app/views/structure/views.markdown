Views
=====

You will find them within

    /app/views

The default [skeleton](/help/skeleton) comes with [haml](http://haml-lang.com/), and we highly recommend it.

Nevertheless you can check the [Sinatra documentation](http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html#views) for a list of all the available templates, just in case.
