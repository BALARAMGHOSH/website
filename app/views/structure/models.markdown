Models
======

You will find them within

    /app/models

The default [skeleton](/help/skeleton) comes by default with [Ohm](/help/ohm), which takes the full advantage of [Redis](/help/redis).

You can check out the [Sinatra documentation](http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html#models) for other options.
