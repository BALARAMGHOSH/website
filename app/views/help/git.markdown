# Monk needs Git #

The Monk executable needs Git in order to clone skeletons, which are Git repositories themselves.

This does not mean you have to use Git to version-control your project (although, of course, you're highly encouraged to!).

If you need to [install Git](http://git-scm.com/download), follow the instructions found on the [official website](http://git-scm.com).

You can learn more about Git by reading [Scott Chacon's book](http://progit.org/book) or by watching the [talk](http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/railsconf-git-talk) he gave at RailsConf '08.
